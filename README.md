# Blog Microservices Platform

A modern, scalable blog platform built with a microservices architecture using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Angular.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

This project follows a microservices pattern with the following components:

### Backend Services
- **API Gateway**: Single entry point for all client requests (Port: 3000)
- **User Service**: Handles authentication, authorization, and user management (Port: 3001)
- **Article Service**: Manages blog articles, comments, and content (Port: 3002)
- **Notification Service**: Real-time notifications using WebSockets (Port: 3003)

### Frontend
- **Angular Application**: Modern single-page application (Port: 4200)

üõ†Ô∏è Services Details
Backend Microservices
API Gateway (Port: 3000)
Routes requests to appropriate microservices

Handles CORS and request logging

Provides health checks and service status

User Service (Port: 3001)
User registration and authentication

JWT token management

Password reset with OTP

Role-based access control (Admin, Editor, Writer, Reader)

Article Service (Port: 3002)
CRUD operations for articles

Comment system with nested replies

Article search and pagination

View counting

Notification Service (Port: 3003)

Frontend Application
This project was generated using Angular CLI version 20.3.3.

Development Server
To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```
Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

Code Scaffolding
Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
For a complete list of available schematics (such as components, directives, or pipes), run:
```
```bash
ng generate --help
```
Building
To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```
This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the dist/ directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

üìä Database Models
User Model
javascript
{
  email: String,
  password: String (hashed),
  firstName: String,
  lastName: String,
  role: String, // ['Admin', 'Editor', 'Writer', 'Reader']
  refreshTokens: Array
}

üß™ Testing the Setup
Check backend services:

bash
curl http://localhost:3000/health
Test API endpoints:

bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/users/test
curl http://localhost:3000/api/articles/health
Verify frontend: Navigate to http://localhost:4200

üö® Troubleshooting
Common Issues
Port conflicts: Ensure ports 3000-3003 and 4200 are available

MongoDB connection: Verify MongoDB is running and MONGO_URI is correct

CORS issues: Check CLIENT_URL in environment variables matches frontend URL

Angular build errors: Ensure Angular CLI is installed globally

Development Tips
Backend services provide detailed console logs for debugging

Use Angular DevTools for frontend debugging

Check browser console for frontend errors

Monitor network tab for API requests

üìà Monitoring
Backend Health Checks
Gateway: http://localhost:3000/status
